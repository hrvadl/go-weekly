# Go weekly 🤓

## Quick start 🚀

### Run app 😬

Make sure you have _make_ tool installed. Then, in the root of the directory run:

```bash
make
```

As alternative option, you can

```bash
cd cmd/goweekly && go run .
```

### Publish in the Telegram channel 📝

_To be done..._

## Local software development 👷🏻

### Code quality 💅🏻

Make sure you have [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) installed and added to your `$PATH`. Then run following command from the root of the repo:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Now, you must install [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) and include it to your path as well.

Congrats, now pre-commit will run before your commits.
Also, in case you're using VSCode linting on save should be integrated into your editor.

**Run linters manually**

```bash
make lint
```

## What's the purpose? 🥸

I **like** _Go_ and I **like** reading tech articles.
I appreciate work from admins of [go-weekly website](https://golangweekly.com/).
But, _I don't like_ to be notified about fresh weekly digest by mail.
I'd like receive weekly digest directly in the telegram, because ... Because, why not?
Also, I'd like to contribute to the Ukrainian golang community and make summaries translated to ukrainian language. 🇺🇦
